        The vast majority of EU legislation is enacted by <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/bills-and-legislation/secondary-legislation/statutory-instruments/">Statutory Instrument</a> under <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/section/2">section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (UK)</a>. It looks like there are at <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/all?text=European%20Communities%20Act%201972">least 6500 of these</a> on Legislation.gov.uk. These laws will need to be examined over the coming months, as the government considers whether to repeal, replace or amend them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://doteveryone.org.uk">Doteveryone</a> has built this website as an experiment to see if it is possible to crowd-source useful data about that body of legislation, and to see if we can use it to make the whole process more transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: is it possible to build a list of all the regulations that relate to workplace rights? What are all the regulations that relate to <a href="{{url_for('tag_browse', tag='policy:privacy')}}">privacy</a>, the <a href="{{url_for('tag_browse', tag='policy:digital')}}">digital economy</a> or <a href="{{url_for('tag_browse', tag='policy:data')}}">data</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        This data doesn't exist anywhere - so we need to try and build it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have put this together very quickly, so please let us know if you <a href="https://github.com/Doteveryone/LegislationTagger/issues">find any bugs</a>.

      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>
        You read a <em>random</em> piece of legislation and record what policy areas you think it might cover and who it might affect.
